# betterAccessViews
Hackathon project for a community driven photo/video uploading project for community accessibility. 

Shows a landing page for the user to enter a location via integrated maps (GMAP API). 

Once confirmed the user is taken to a new page to submit photos.

Lastly, the user is asked to rate the severity of the issue.

NOTE: 

  Currently you will need to add your own API key in the html <script> section in order for the integrated maps to work
  
  This is subject to change as the project gets further along and gets deployed (ie: it is locally run at this time)
